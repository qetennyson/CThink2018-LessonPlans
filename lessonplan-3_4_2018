Lesson Plan Week of Mar 3 2018

Mon:
	1. Sprint 2 for Review Program
		- may switch to an everyday class scrum to help review what's necessary to 
		implement this sprint's concept.  About 10 minutes of class time spent on this.
		- maybe worth it to make these lesson plans more granular (minute by minute?)	

Tue: 
	2. Go over Review Program
		- discuss how we solved the given problem.
		- review various solutions, talk about pros/cons among these solutions.
		- peer code review

Wed: 
	3. Assessment / Space X Video
		 - check student understanding of what we've learned over the past 1.5 weeks
		 - space x video discusses use of C++, flipped bits, fail-safe engineering

Thur:
	4. Language Discussion / Guided Code HS Time
		- space x video offers an opportunity to extend our discussion to include
		uses of specific languages, value of high-level vs. low-level languages, etc.
		- possibly a good place to talk about why the problem solving process is more
		critical than language selection.

Fri:
	5. Guided Code HS Time
