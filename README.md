# CThink2018-LessonPlans
Set of lesson plans for Computational Thinking 2018 at Fern Creek High School

** note : I began teaching this course in the latter half.  We were on a trimester system this year, and this is the 2nd trimester.  Kids have not been back in Python for months, and remediation is critical.

# Concept
I want to experiment with lesson planning using git, so I can always reference what I've done and how I've evolved as a teacher.  This also ensures lesson plan availability for my students if they are so inclined to look.  This doesn't replace me writing the agenda on the board everyday, or any form of classroom interaction.  Rather, it is simply a good exercise for me to come to GitHub every week, regardless of how much I'm relying on Git at any specific time.

I'm not certain what I may extend this idea to, but for now, we'll stick with lesson plans.
